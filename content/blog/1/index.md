### Step 1: Setting up the React App
The first step in building a responsive web application using React is setting up the development environment. This can be done by installing Node.js, creating a new React app using the Create React App CLI, and adding necessary dependencies such as React-Bootstrap.

### Step 2: Creating the Layout
The next step is creating the layout of the web application. This involves dividing the application into various components such as header, navigation, footer, and content. React provides various tools such as JSX and CSS modules to create reusable components that can be easily styled using CSS.

### Step 3: Adding Responsive Design
To make the web application responsive, it is essential to use responsive design techniques such as media queries and flexible grids. React provides various responsive design libraries such as React-Responsive and React-Flexbox-Grid, which can be used to create responsive layouts.

### Step 4: Testing and Debugging
Testing and debugging are crucial steps in the development process. React provides various tools such as Jest and Enzyme for unit testing and debugging. It is essential to test the web application across various devices and platforms to ensure that it is responsive and bug-free.

### Step 5: Deployment
The final step is deploying the web application to a production server. React provides various tools such as Webpack and Babel for bundling and optimizing the application for production. It is essential to test the web application in the production environment to ensure that it is functioning correctly.

### Conclusion
In this blog post, I have discussed how to build a responsive web application using React. By following these steps, you can create a responsive web application that can be easily accessed across various devices and platforms. Remember to test and debug the application thoroughly before deploying it to a production server.

# Customized JSON Resume Theme: StackOverflow

üñºÔ∏è This is a tweaked version of the [StackOverflow theme](https://github.com/phoinixi/jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow). Tweaked to fit my design preferences. Published on NPM and GitHub Registry.

## Notable Changes

* 2 Page version in PDF/printable mode 
* Added sections for speaking and articles
* Style changes

## Prerequisites

To build and start the local server, it needs to use the cli command, which is custom cli I tweaked.

`npm i @anthonyjdella/customized-resume-cli`

## How to Start

`npm run start`

## How to Change

* `resume.hbs` is the order of the resume.
* `theme/partials/` are the html files for each section
* `style.css` is the styling
* To make changes to the PDF/printable version, make changes in the `@print` section of `style.css`
* Change version number in `package.json`
* Deploy the changes via `npm publish --access public`
* To see changes from `resume.anthonydellavecchia.com` you need to go to the [registry project](https://github.com/anthonyjdella/customized-registry-functions), then cd into `functions`, run `npm i` and `npm update`, then `firebase deploy`.

To build your own resume, create a 'resume.json' file in the current folder and follow the [json resume schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/)

### Social Profiles Icons

**Profiles supported with brand colors:**

github, stack overflow, linkedin, dribbble, twitter, facebook, pinterest, instagram, soundcloud, wordpress, youtube, flickr, google plus, tumblr, foursquare.

To have a social icon close the social link profile (or username) it is enough to set a `network` the name of the Social Network (es: 'Stack Overflow').

With stackoverflow theme it is possible to add:

- `keywords` to each 'work', 'publication' and 'volunteer' item
- `summary` to each 'interests' and 'education' item
- `location` to each 'work', 'education' and 'volunteer' item
- `birth` to 'basics'

```
"location": {
  "city": "Z√ºrich",
  "countryCode": "CH",
  "region": "Switzerland"
} 
```
